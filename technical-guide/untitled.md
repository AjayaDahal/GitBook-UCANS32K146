# Getting started

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT  
This user guide should contain most information you need to get your UCANS32K146 up and running. Most pages **should be read in order**. Sometimes a link to another page or external source is provided. It is often useful to have a \(quick\) look at the information found on the external page before you continue reading on this GitBook. 

Also, remember that GitBook has a search function - use it to locate specific details quickly! You can find the search box on the right side at the top of the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
 Questions can be asked on the [PX4 community Slack and Discuss forum](). If anything remains unclear or if wrong information is provided, you can [contact the HoverGames team]().
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# example comment
echo 'example print string'
```
{% endcode %}
